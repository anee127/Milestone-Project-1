This website showcases my skills and experience as a personal resume website. It includes some features about me as well as my details and CV to appeal to potential recruiter/employers.

## **User Experience (UX)**
### Purpose
For this first milestone project the purpose is to create a personal website to showcase my skills and experience to become a full stack software developer, and so that it will give me a chance to be noticed by potential recruiters. 

### User Stories
1.	As a user of a recruiter, I should be able to easily navigate through the website to find relevant information.
2.	As a user of a recruiter, I should be able to use the website on any device without problem. 
3.	As a user of a recruiter, I should be able to find out about the creator on the first page including their contact details. 
4.	As a user of a recruiter, I should be able to read through the creators’ CV and be able to download a copy. 
5.	As a user of a recruiter, I should be able to see their relevant skills.
6.	As a user of a recruiter, I should be able to contact the creator with any message or feedback that I would like to give. 
7.	As a user of a recruiter, I should be able to access links to their social media accounts. 
### Design
**Structure**
-	I opted for a basic website design structure with a simple header and hero image repeated to keep the website minimalistic. 
**Colour Scheme**
-	A pastel minimalistic colour scheme in contrast to dark grey text to make is easier to read. 
-	The key colours being grey, blue, pink and yellow.
-	The colours used tie in with the colours in the hero image to keep the scheme through out the website.
-	The majority of the background is white to avoid visual clashes and create more emphasis on the text.

**Typography**
The Poppins font is used throughout the website, it is a rounded and easy to read font.  Arvo is used for emphasis with some words. Sans serif is the backup font in case the original font does not load onto the website. Coiny is used for the web logo only to make it stand out from the rest of the text.

**Wireframes**
At the start of the project I designed the wireframes using Balsamiq. The mock-ups made it easier to plan the responsive design and structure of the website.

## **Features**
### Existing Features
- **Header**
Navbar: used bootstrap to create a responsive navbar with my name as the logo which will contain a link to the ‘About’ page.
On standard and large screens the navbar menu will be shown as: About, CV and Contact, consecutively.
For medium and small screens the nav link will be within a hamburger icon button displaying as: About, CV and Contact, in a descending order.
- **Sections**
About page: This contains a brief introduction to myself, my contact details and links to my projects. 
CV page: Has a timeline of my education and work experience as well as progress bars to represent my skills. 
Contact page: this contains a form in which a user can provide their contact information and a message that can be submitted to myself. 
- **Footer**
The footer had my copyright information, a download link to a pdf of my cv that is printable and links to my social media that will all open in a new page. 
### Features Left to Include
- **Future features**
I will be using this site to promote myself in the future so will update the CV and skills section when required. I will also update the ‘My Projects’ section to include more recent and better projects but will keep the same layout and just include them towards the bottom. Once I have more than 6 projects I will create a whole page just for them and provide a link on the homepage.
