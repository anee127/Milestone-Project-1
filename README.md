**This Resume is part of the first Milestone Project carried out through the Code Institute.**

This website showcases my skills and experience as a personal resume website. It includes some features about me as well as my details and CV to appeal to potential recruiter/employers.

## **User Experience (UX)**
### Purpose
For this first milestone project the purpose is to create a personal website to showcase my skills and experience to become a full stack software developer, and so that it will give me a chance to be noticed by potential recruiters. 

### User Stories
1.	As a user of a recruiter, I should be able to easily navigate through the website to find relevant information.
2.	As a user of a recruiter, I should be able to use the website on any device without problem. 
3.	As a user of a recruiter, I should be able to find out about the creator on the first page including their contact details. 
4.	As a user of a recruiter, I should be able to read through the creatorsâ€™ CV and be able to download a copy. 
5.	As a user of a recruiter, I should be able to see their relevant skills.
6.	As a user of a recruiter, I should be able to contact the creator with any message or feedback that I would like to give. 
7.	As a user of a recruiter, I should be able to access links to their social media accounts. 
### Design
**Structure**
-	I opted for a basic website design structure with a simple header and hero image repeated to keep the website minimalistic. 
**Colour Scheme**
-	A pastel minimalistic colour scheme in contrast to dark text to make is easier to read. 
-	The key colours being grey, baby blue and salmon.
-	The majority of the background is white to avoid visual clashes and create more emphasis on the text. 
**Typography**
The Poppins font is used throughout the website, it is a rounded and easy to read font.  Arvo is used for emphasis with some words. Sans serif is the backup font in case the original font does not load onto the website. 

**Wireframes**
At the start of the project I designed the wireframes using Balsamiq. The mock-ups made it easier to plan the responsive design and structure of the website.
